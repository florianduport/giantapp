Simple plugin that checks your WordPress install and shows your file permissions, size, and last modified date. 

== Description ==

Will add a little "x" next to any files/folders set to 777, since this is inherently insecure. Checks all recursive folders that come with a default WordPress install.

This plugin can be CPU intensive as it iterates over your whole folder/file structure to gather statistics.

Notes :

*   Checks root, wp-admin, wp-content, wp-includes and all sub folders
*   Includes your plugin and theme folders
*   Ignores images, text, CSS , and translation files
*   Will exclude the cache folders since they contain to many files to scan.
*   Requires PHP 5.1.2 or greater
*   Please run this during low traffic.
    
**This plugin will not return accurate results under IIS or WAMP stack due to how windows handles file permissions.**
